IUSB - Virtual Media Protocol

07/22/15 - Adding initial commit of Wireshark Dissector and a very early, dirty Python script to talk the protocol.
07/30/15 - Updated Python script a bit. Successfully serves the file, and can be queried from OS. Still need to fix some data transfer things but this one actually works for the most part. ToDo: Split up Data packet to extract command/size/data/etc.
